# Player

the player uses hardcoded date within the server but Im not sure if it will be better to use a cms or not. maybe even use an api from like spotify or something.

# SWR
(stale-while-revalidate) is a HTTP caching strategy where the data is first retrieved from cache (if available), then a fetch is made and data is then updated. Using SWR, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and automatically [see docs](https://swr.vercel.app/)
