using the dynamic pretitle and title allows for much better seo, a huge benefit to musicians

for the location sequence in the Hero component I can add jokes instead of the animation sequence to add a personal touch to the site

# Player

the player uses hardcoded date within the server but Im not sure if it will be better to use a cms or not. maybe even use an api from like spotify or something.
